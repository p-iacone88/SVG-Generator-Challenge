# SVG Generator

## Description

This Node.js command-line application is a practical tool for quick and easy SVG logo creation. This project provides a readily available, DIY solution for generating logos. Building this application pushed me to master new skills and concepts while practicing a practical application for Object-Based-Programming. I delved deeper into Node.js, explored the details of SVG file creation, built classes, and gained valuable experience in building a user-friendly command-line interface. The process also highlighted the importance of modularity and code organization, as I structured the application for clean and maintainable code.

The user can choose up to 3 characters for the logo text, choose one of three shapes, choose a background color for the shape, as well as choose the font color for the logo text.
